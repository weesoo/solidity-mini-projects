# Solidity Mini Projects – Blokkat Bootcamp

This repository includes beginner-level smart contracts developed during the **Blokkat Arabic Blockchain Bootcamp**, focused on building foundational skills in **Ethereum**, **Solidity**, and **smart contract development**.

---

## 📘 Overview

🧠 **Technologies**: Solidity, Foundry, OpenZeppelin  
🔬 **Topics**: ERC20, ERC721, NFTs, Ethereum basics, Smart Contract Architecture  
🛠️ **Tools**: Remix IDE, Foundry, IPFS (intro level), OpenZeppelin Libraries

> All contracts in this repo were created for learning purposes and represent early steps in my journey into blockchain development.

## ✅ Projects Included

### 1. `HelloWorld.sol`
A simple smart contract that stores and updates a message.
- Demonstrates contract structure, constructor usage, and public state variables.

### 2. `BasicToken.sol`
A minimal ERC20 token contract using OpenZeppelin's standard.
- Token Name: **BasicToken**
- Symbol: **BTK**
- Mints 1000 tokens to the deployer's wallet.

### 3. `SimpleNFT.sol`
An ERC721 contract for minting basic NFTs using OpenZeppelin.
- NFT Collection: **MyNFT**
- Symbol: **MNFT**
- Uses `Counters` to manage token IDs.

## 📌 Notes

- Projects were tested using **Foundry** and deployed on local test environments.
- These contracts are **not production-ready** and are intended for learning and showcasing my progress during the bootcamp.
