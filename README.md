# Blokkat Solidity Bootcamp â€“ Learning Projects

This repository contains beginner-level smart contracts developed as part of the **Blokkat Arabic Blockchain Bootcamp**.  
The projects explore Ethereum basics, ERC standards, and smart contract deployment using **Solidity**, **Foundry**, and **OpenZeppelin** libraries.

ğŸ§  **Technologies**: Solidity, Foundry, OpenZeppelin  
ğŸ”¬ **Focus**: ERC20, ERC721, Smart Contracts Basics  
ğŸš€ **Tools**: Remix IDE, Foundry, IPFS (Intro Level)

## âœ… Projects Included:

### 1. `HelloWorld.sol`
A simple smart contract that stores and updates a message string.
- Teaches constructor usage, storage variables, and basic function calls.

### 2. `BasicToken.sol`
A minimal ERC20 token created using OpenZeppelinâ€™s standard implementation.
- Token name: **BasicToken**
- Symbol: **BTK**
- Mints 1000 tokens to the deployer.

### 3. `SimpleNFT.sol`
An ERC721 NFT contract that allows minting unique NFTs.
- NFT Collection: **MyNFT**
- Symbol: **MNFT**
- Uses counters to track token IDs.
- Implements minting function with recipient address.
